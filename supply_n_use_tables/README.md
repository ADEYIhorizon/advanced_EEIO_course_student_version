# Exercise 2

## Learning goals
- Understand the structure of supply and use tables
- Practice and interpret the industry aggregation/disaggregation in SUT
- Understand how to transform SUTs into IOT

## Exercise instructions

### Exercise 1
Download the supply and use tables of the Netherlands for the year 2019.
https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/custom/2020/29/supply-and-use-input-output-and-sector-accounts.

1. Select two products in a region for the year 2019
2. Perform two hotspot analyses by region one of the supply and one of the use (visualize them in bar graphs)
3. To which countries are the selected products exported, and which region imports the most  
4. How much intraindustry imports contributes to the manufacturing of the selected products and from the selected region?
5. Can you please visualize in a bar graph the breakdown of final consumption (by category and region)?
6. Can you perform the same for gross fixed capital formation?  

### Exercise 2
1. In the use table, aggregate the industries into three sectors: primary sector, secondary sector, and
tertiary sector.
2. To which aggregated sector does your selected category belong?

### Exercise 3
1. Following the instruction presented during the lecture implement the following two transformations methods from SUTs to IOT:
    - Industry Technology Assumption in Product-by-Product format
    - Industry Technology Assumption in Industry-by-Industry format
