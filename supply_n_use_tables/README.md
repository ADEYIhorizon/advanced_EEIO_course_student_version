Week 7 Supply and use tables

Objectives
· Understand the structure of supply and use tables
· Practice and interpret the industry aggregation/disaggregation in SUT
· Interpret the structural changes of supply/use in a given time period

Practice the following based on the supply and use tables of the Netherlands from 2015-2019.
https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/custom/2020/29/supply-and-use-input-output-and-sector-accounts.

1. Pick two products, and analyse the supply structure (domestic supply and imports) of each
product for the year of 2019. 

[comment]: <> (point 1 not specific enough. Rephrase to "perform a hotspot analysis of the supply and use of an industry of your choosing". If we want the discussion on import, then we can ask "please identify, the portion of input contributing to industry's supply")

2. In the use table, aggregate the industries into three sectors: primary sector, secondary sector, and
tertiary sector for the year 2018 and 2019.

3. Pick a product, and plot and analyse its intermediate consumption by three sectors, final
consumption, gross capital formation and exports for year 2018 and 2019.


[comment]: <> (Ideally point 1 and 3 would be merged and would be more specific. For instance: "Select 3 industries of your choosing from each basic sector [i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary] and plot in bargraphs the transactions from the following SUTs parts: 1. supply; 2. intermediate consumption; 3. final consumption; 4. gross fixed capital formation ")

[comment]: <> (There could be a forth point, asking student to use two types of transformation methods)
