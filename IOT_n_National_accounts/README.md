# Exercise 1
In this exercise, you will practice how to apply the three methods to calculate national GDP, using different databases and years.  
While the exercise is quantitive, try to reason about differences and implications of the methods as well as results from the method application.
## Learning goals

- Analysing GDP trends
- Implementing GDP calculation methods in different contexts
- Understanding the data structure difference between SNA and IO tables 
- Understanding the implications of quantitative results

## Execise instructions

Data should be downloaded, loaded and plotted in python

Data source 1: eurostat, national accounts https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database?node_code=lfsq
Data source 2: CBS https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/custom/2020/29/supply-and-use-input-output-and-sector-accounts

For EU-27 and The Netherlands, respectively, obtain, plot, and analyze the following NAs time series for all years available starting from the year 2000 (annual)
1. Plot two line graphs showing the yearly GDP change (absolute and relative) since 2000 for the 3 regions
2. Calculate for the latest year available the GDP total and its composition using the three approaches:
    -   expenditure perspective (GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + Net Export)
    -   production perspective (GDP =  sum of all value added of all production activities)
    -   income perspective (GDP = Total National Income + Sales Taxes + Depreciation + Net Foreign Factor Income)

3. Answer the following questions:
    - Which investment has the largest contribution to GDP?
    - Which sector in the Netherlands has the largest GDP?
