# Two IO models: Leontief vs Ghosh models
## Learning goals
- Apply the Leontief models 
- Apply the Ghosh model
- Measure forward and backward linkages

## Execise instructions
In the previous lecture, you transformed Supply and Use tables into IO tables. 
In this exercise, you will use those IO tables to calculate the Leontief and Ghosh models. 

Before you apply it to the IO tables you have calculated, you can try a toy model shown in the jupyter notebook which should help you familiarize yourself with the procedure.
